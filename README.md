# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋
Hello, I'm Ella, a software developer passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly applications. My expertise spans a range of technologies, including React, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, Next.js, Postgres and more. I'm dedicated to staying at the forefront of software development by exploring and learning new tools.

## Current Projects 🚀
#### Two Minds One: 
This unique project, inspired by Jonathan Haidt's "The Righteous Mind," fosters understanding and unity by providing a safe space for constructive dialogue among individuals with differing opinions. 🗣️

#### Ink & Pages:
As an avid reader, I'm developing the best way to seamlessly update and track your book collection and reading lists on the go, making technology work for us in our daily lives. 📘

#### Online Library: 
A rebuild of "Ink and Pages" using client-side rendering, this project was a challenge designed to deepen my understanding of fundamental technologies, using only Node.js, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript. 📖📚

### Portfolio Website: 
My portfolio website is a canvas where I showcase my creative side through programming. It's a platform where I share the projects I've built and demonstrate my love for both design and technology. 💻🎨
